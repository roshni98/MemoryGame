## How To Play
 Click on a card and then try to guess where the matching other card is and click on that card. If it turns out to be a match then both will stay flipped but if its not then they will flip back to how it was. This will keep going until you find all the pairs.

## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the [Udacity Classroom](https://classroom.udacity.com/me).
